# Spacevania - Temp/Collab
This branch exists for when we need to temporarily pull from another branch to make some questionable and messy changes. Or if we need to pull from a personal branch in order to collaborate.

This branch must always have/pull from the latest version of the develop branch, whenever we finish using it. In order to make way for the next time this branch is used.

TLDR:
* this is a temp branch
* clean after use
